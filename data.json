When you think back to the first basketball shoes, amazing names come to mind. Forum, Rivalry, Streetball, Americana and Top Ten are on our shortlist of on-court greatness. And today we bring our iconic adidas Superstar back to its roots with a design that's inspired by a vintage B-ball favourite: The Americana. The red, white and blue colourway remains, just minus the hi-top. This shoe is just one out of our special Starting Five pack. Choose your favourite, or build your wall of fame.",

Ahead of the 2020 All-Star Weekend, we've rebuilt the shoe with a fat tongue for extra slam dunk. Step into the future of no fuss comfort without sacrificing on old-school class.",
